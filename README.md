# Market Automation 
This project is a market automation system developed using object-oriented programming principles. The system aims to automate and manage daily operations in markets. The system was built without using SQL.
The system is designed based on object-oriented programming principles. Concepts such as classes, interfaces, abstracts, and polymorphism are effectively used. Additionally, LINQ is utilized for data querying and manipulation.

## Login Page
This page has both administrator and staff login. The administrator login is predefined with the username “admin” and the password “123”. After logging in as admin, the administrator can assign usernames and passwords to the staff, who can then access the system with those credentials. The administrator can also access the staff screen, but the staff can only access their own page. If the user wants to check whether they entered the password correctly, they can click on the password icon and the password will appear
